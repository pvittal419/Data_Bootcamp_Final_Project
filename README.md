# Data_Bootcamp_Final_Project

This project was completed by Pooja Vittal in partial fulfilment of ECON-UB.0232, Data Bootcamp, Fall 2017. 
I certify that the NYU Stern Honor Code applies to this project. In particular, I have:

Clearly acknowledged the work and efforts of others when submitting written work as our own.
The incorporation of the work of others–including but not limited to their ideas, data, creative
expression, and direct quotations (which should be designated with quotation marks), or paraphrasing
thereof– has been fully and appropriately referenced using notations both in the text
and the bibliography.

And I understand that:

Submitting the same or substantially similar work in multiple courses, either in the same semester
or in a different semester, without the express approval of all instructors is strictly forbidden.

I acknowledge that a failure to abide by NYU Stern Honor Code will result in a failing grade for
the project and course.

### Project Description

In the United States, there are increasing educational disparities between the rich and poor, with richer students attending public schools that have more resources, which creates the trend of the richer students attending college, and the poorer students falling behind. With this knowledge in mind, I will be joining Teach for America post-graduation, and I will be teaching High School Math in Eastern North Carolina, so my project focuses on STEM Education disparities across household income using data from the Census and North Carolina State Department of Education.
